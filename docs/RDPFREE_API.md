# RdpFree native API v1

Base URL: `https://rdpfree.projectkal.my.id/api/v1`

## Authentication

1. Log in on the website. Open `/dashboard/devices` (XyDesk menu).
2. Create a device token. Copy it once into XyDesk Remote.
3. Every native request sends `Authorization: Bearer <device-token>`.
4. Store the token in Android Keystore-backed CredentialVault. Do not log it, put it in an intent/URL, or store it in ordinary preferences.
5. Tokens expire after 30 days. Create a replacement in the website. Revoke lost devices from the same page or use POST `/device/revoke` to revoke self.

Device tokens are random 256-bit credentials; D1 stores only their SHA-256 hashes. The associated GitHub credential is encrypted with the server session key. Device scope is repository read, settings read/write, workflow list/start/cancel for the issuing account's fixed repository. Tokens cannot access admin routes, mint other tokens, or manage other devices. Password changes do not revoke independently issued devices: explicitly revoke devices if compromised.

Admin login is **not** an API login method. Admin email/password + Turnstile is browser-only and has no OAuth fallback. Do not embed admin credentials, GitHub PATs, or Turnstile secrets into the APK.

## Endpoints

| Method | Endpoint | Behavior |
|---|---|---|
| GET | `/repository` | Repository URL, default branch, permissions |
| GET | `/repository?path=scripts` | Repository folder/file content; browser only previews small files |
| GET | `/settings` | `{repo, inputs, choices, workflow}` |
| PUT | `/settings` | `{ "inputs": { ... } }`; validates and persists settings for the next run |
| GET | `/status` | Active/latest run, phase, current-session timestamps and connection |
| GET | `/runs` | Up to 30 recent runs for `rdp-6h.yml` |
| POST | `/runs` | `{ "confirm": true }`; dispatches using saved settings and repo's default branch |
| GET | `/runs/{id}/jobs` | Job/step status. Full textual logs are linked to GitHub on the website |
| POST | `/runs/{id}/cancel` | `{ "confirm": true }`; cancels a run only if it belongs to `rdp-6h.yml` |
| POST | `/device/revoke` | Revokes the requesting device token |

Browser-only `/devices`: GET lists device metadata, POST `{name}` issues a token, DELETE `{id}` revokes. Mutating browser requests require an exact same-origin `Origin` header and a valid HttpOnly session. Bearer devices cannot call these endpoints.

### Connection response example (illustrative, not an actual active RDP)

```json
{
  "repo": "xykal/XyRDP",
  "phase": "ready",
  "active": true,
  "run": { "id": 123, "status": "in_progress", "html_url": "https://github.com/xykal/XyRDP/actions/runs/123" },
  "session": { "hostname": "rdpfree", "started_at": "2026-10-10T18:00:00Z", "expires_at": "2026-10-10T18:30:00Z", "username": "xyadmin" },
  "connection": { "host": "example.invalid", "port": 3389, "username": "xyadmin", "password_required": true, "transport": "tunnel" },
  "server_time": "2026-10-10T18:05:00Z"
}
```

`phase` is `stopped`, `preparing`, or `ready`. Connection is null unless the status file's run ID matches a live run and the session has not expired. Poll every 15 seconds while the screen is active; back off on errors. Recheck status before connecting. `ready` means a current workflow published connection data, not that this API has independently tested RDP reachability.

RDP_PASSWORD is a GitHub Actions secret and **cannot be retrieved**. Prompt for it in the app. Do not publish it in status JSON. API HTTPS is the control plane, not a TCP relay. XyDesk connects to the returned host/port; a Tailscale connection also requires the appropriate network client.

## Settings

Fields mirror `.github/workflows/rdp-6h.yml`:
`durasi_menit`, `hostname`, `rdp_user`, `akses`, `tunnel_provider`, `storage_boost`, `debloat`, `samp`, `samp_extra`, `gta_sa_url`, `win10`, `xydesk`, `ekstra`, `grafis`, `wallpaper_url`.

Get allowed choice values from `/settings`, do not invent input names. Default user `xyadmin`; optional `runneradmin` is accepted. Workflow job timeout is 360 minutes including setup, so a requested 360-minute session is not a guarantee of 360 minutes of usable desktop time. Settings do not alter already running jobs.

Dispatch requires repository write permission, no active/queued run, and required Actions secrets (`RDP_PASSWORD`, plus Tailscale/ngrok keys when selected). Two start attempts per 5 minutes; an atomic 90-second repository lock prevents duplicate dispatch during GitHub eventual consistency. The application does not restart sessions automatically or promise protection against GitHub account enforcement. Use Actions in accordance with account policies and quotas.

## Errors and retry rules

Errors are JSON `{error: "message"}` with `Cache-Control: private, no-store`.
- 400 invalid settings/confirmation or missing repository secrets.
- 401 session/token invalid or expired; ask for a new token.
- 403 insufficient permission, wrong origin, or restricted endpoint.
- 404 repository/workflow/file not found.
- 409 run active or dispatch lock held.
- 429 start/token issuance throttled; wait before trying again.
- 502/503 GitHub/network/service error; show message and preserve the user's screen.

Never automatically retry POST `/runs` after an ambiguous network error. Refresh `/status`/`runs` first and require a new explicit user action. No wildcard browser CORS: native HTTPS clients do not need CORS.

## Android integration

Native entry point: Devices → RdpFree. The user opens the website in their external browser to issue a device token, then pastes it into the native screen. This is not a WebView integration. Credentials are encrypted using the existing Android Keystore-backed `CredentialVault` under key `rdpfree-api-device-v1`.

`RdpFreeApi.kt` uses HTTPS only, refuses redirects, caps response size, runs requests on Dispatchers.IO and does not retry mutations automatically. `RdpFreeScreen.kt` polls at 15 seconds while STARTED (30 seconds after errors), supports saved duration, explicit run/stop confirmation and token revocation. The app rechecks current status before handing a ConnectionProfile to the existing RDP/biometric connection path. RDP password is entered locally and not automatically persisted. Other workflow options remain available in website Settings.

Parser tests cover token format, invalid connection ports/hosts and stale session data. Android build/device acceptance is still required; no release APK was generated by this migration. No host audio/microphone/PC-stream wire protocol was modified.
